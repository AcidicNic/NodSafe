Better safe than sorry

In Case of an Emergency

* Don‚Äôt be afraid to call the 911 in the case of a drug related emergency. There are laws to protect you.

Mixing Substances? Check if the combo is safe!

* combo.tripsit.me memorize it, bookmark it, download the TripSit.me Android app, or download this chart. Whatever you do, make sure you can access this tool if you need it. All you have to do is click on the substances you want to mix. It‚Äôs also a good idea to do some research outside of this tool.

Need to Talk to Someone?

* FireSide Project ~ A psychedelic peer support line that you can text or call. (623) 473 743 or 6‚Äì2FIRESIDE
* Tripsit.me IRC chat ~ If you need to talk to someone to calm down, or if you just want to chat about drugs.
* r/Drugs Discord~ A community full of people you can chat with about harm reduction, specific substances, or whatever‚Äôs on your mind.

üö®Test Kits!üö®

* Testing your drugs is important. You can test many different substances, many times with just one kit. You only need a drop of the reagent liquid and a small amount of your substance. Then you pay attention to the color of the mixture over the course of a minute or so, and you‚Äôll have a pretty good idea of what drug you have. If you buy a couple different reagent tests, you‚Äôll get more accurate results by seeing how your substance reacts to each reagent.

Why You Should Test Your Substances

* If you get your substances from anywhere other than a pharmacy or your own grow, you can‚Äôt be sure what‚Äôs in it. Especially when it comes to pills and powders. Best case, it‚Äôs exactly what you thought it‚Äôd be maybe cut with harmless filler. Worst case, it‚Äôs a different substance that could be dangerous and the dosage might not match up with what you think you're taking. If this is the case, you could take a harmful or even deadly amount of that other substance, thinking it‚Äôs a normal amount of the drug you thought you had. This can lead to overdosing on a drug that you didn‚Äôt even know you were taking.
