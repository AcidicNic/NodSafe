# How to help / more info

hit me up with any suggestions

don't worry about if it sounds like it'd be hard to add

## Layout

if you have ideas about the layout of the website, a sketch/photo or link to a reference would be helpful to understand the vision

## Text / Images

any text and images can be easily swapped out/added

## Color sheme

This project uses DaisyUI, which comes with a variety of theme presets. A theme is a set of colors that are automatically applied to all of the content on the website


* [DaisyUI Themes](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/)
  * Scroll down to "List of themes", then you can click on any of these to preview the theme on DaisyUI's website

currently using "valentine" for light mode and "halloween" for dark mode.

custom themes are possible too, just need the colors in hex (like #42f563)

## Favicon

the little icon next to the title on a tab

this thing:
<img src="https://bst.icons8.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/favicon-design-icons8-blog.jpg" width="200" />

send me a png to change this

## Domain name
