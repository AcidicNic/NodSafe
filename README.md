# How to help / more info

hit me up with any suggestions

don't worry about if it's something that sounds like it'd be hard to add, just let me know if you have ideas

can be one of the following things or something else

## Layout

ik it's kinda basic looking rn. if you have ideas about the layout, a sketch/photo or link to a reference would be helpful to understand the vision

## Text / Images

any text and images can be easily swapped out/added

## Colors

This project uses DaisyUI, which comes with a variety of theme presets. A theme is a set of colors that are automatically applied to all of the content on the website

This is super easy to change btw

### theme presets

* [DaisyUI Themes](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/)
  * Scroll down to "List of themes", then you can click on any of these to preview the theme on DaisyUI's website

We're currently using "valentine" for light mode and "halloween" for dark mode.

### custom themes

custom themes are possible too, just need the colors in hex (like #42f563)

## Favicon

the little icon next to the title on a tab

this thing:
<img src="https://bst.icons8.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/favicon-design-icons8-blog.jpg" width="200" />

send me a png to change this
